## Security Best Practices

While this project is for demonstration purposes only, here are some general security best practices to consider:

- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update your dependencies to the latest versions to ensure you have the latest security patches.
- **Use Secure Coding Practices**: Follow secure coding guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Validate Input**: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent malicious data from being processed by your application.
- **Use HTTPS**: Ensure that your application uses HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.
- **Limit Permissions**: Follow the principle of least privilege by granting only the necessary permissions to your application and its components.
